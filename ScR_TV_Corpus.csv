In this study, the literature on rural tourism was collected from the Elsevier ScienceDirect database since 2010 and analyzed. The conclusions are that: (1) The development of rural tourism under the economic value orientation is a hot topic for scholars in various countries. Based on the modern economic and industrial attributes of rural tourism, scholars have explored its development modes and paths, and studied the development conditions, resource utilization, product creation, market expansion, and influencing factors of rural tourism. In addition, scholars have examined the definition, measurement, and implementation of sustainable rural tourism development. (2) The motivation of rural tourists is diverse, the way and content of their experiences are different, and consumer satisfaction with services and products is an important factor affecting their loyalty. (3) Scholars have paid more attention to the development of rural enterprises and studied the application of information technology in rural tourism enterprises. Small business development faces various limitations, and innovation and cooperation are very important. (4) Residents have different attitudes towards the development of tourism. Community participation is the key factor to ensure the social equity of rural tourism development. The research in this field is often about facilitating participation. (5) Government intervention shows different effects from national macrolevel control and local practices, and its research is often integrated with other fields. (6) Study on the impact of rural tourism presents critical thinking. In the empirical study of communities, the positive economic impact of tourism is questioned. Cultural change of destinations cannot be simply characterized as“negative”or“passive.”The social influence includes change in the thoughts of the residents, identity construction, and evolution of community relations, race, nationality, and national identity, among others. Overall, most international scholars regard rural tourism as an economic behavior. Tourism, as the carrier of modernization, has exerted a comprehensive and far- reaching influence on traditional villages. As a practice field of capital, rural tourism destination has produced a series of negative effects.

To make initial inquiries into these issues, this study collected data for Shuikou Town, Huzhou City, and used multiple clustering methods to identify the following three subgroups: wellbeing stayers, rural-life stayers, and multi-experience stayers. The qualitative analysis results showed that unlike their Western counterparts, most of the elderly rural stayers are characterised by extensive socialising, but as Chinese parents, they cannot free themselves fully from the burden of their extended family, which, altogether, leads to their unique behavioural patterns.

In order to achieve this objective, the present study employed a range of methods, including on-site observation, laser measurement (surveying), utilisation of oral sources, texture analysis, typological comparison, and SWOT analysis. These methods were selected for their suitability for the protection of rural architecture in a context of ecotourism. In order to develop rural tourism in a manner that preserves the cultural heritage, a series of solution proposals have been developed under a number of different headings, including transportation, accessibility, the physical condition of buildings, socio-economic factors, and the tourism sector. In making decisions, consideration was given to the potential for ecotourism in the Sütçüler district, to which Beydili is connected. The principal objective of this research is to present the findings of the study, which focuses on cultural heritage and its conservation in order to ensure the sustainability of ecotourism planning in rural areas, with a specific case study of Beydilli Village in the Sütçüler District of Isparta.

This paper argues for the need to go beyond these frameworks in conceptualizing the varied pathways and outcomes of rural land takings. It presents a comparative case study of two villages in China, whose land has been redeployed for tourism development. In one village, state-led expropriation led to the loss of land rights and the resettlement of villagers in new housing complexes. In another, villagers held onto land ownership and their property but saw intra-community inequalities amplified as residents were differentially incorporated into the tourism economy.

Function identification of rural elements can contribute to the scientific decision-making and efficient management of the rural communities. However, some factors have posed important driving forces on the unclear main functions and homogeneous development of rural areas. The classification of the rural regions is usually limited to the functional level, but rarely to the factor level in most previous studies. This study aims to clarify the fuzzy orientation of the main function, and then to propose guiding strategies according to local conditions, using the coupling relationship of “factor and function”. 128 villages in Wannian County of Jiangxi Province, China were taken as the study area. A systematic analysis was made on the capital, labor, facilities, resources, and environment of the villages. A multifactor comprehensive method was selected to calculate the advantage index of rural factor allocation. A self-organizing competitive network and an unsupervised algorithm using competitive learning rules were utilized to divide the types of rural factors. An “element-function” linkage matrix was used to identify the types of rural function, and thereby define the differentiated strategies of rural settlements. The results showed as follows: 1) there was a significant difference in the spatial distribution of dominant degree of the comprehensive allocation of rural factors in Wannian County. Specifically, the advantage index in the northeast county was higher than that in the southwest, while that in the north county was better than that in the south. Four categories were divided into the villages with the high, middle high, middle low, and low, advantage index. 2) In the self-organizing competitive network, eight types were also divided into the combination types of rural factors in Wannian County, such as environment and labor dominant type.

In the villages of production-oriented function, the agglomeration strategy could be established to integrate three industries, while accelerating the industrial transformation and upgrading.

DOI: 10.1108/IJTC-05-2022-0117",2024,Tourist walkability and sustainable community-based tourism: conceptual framework and strategic model,International Journal of Tourism Cities,"Purpose – This paper aims to determine the significance of tourist walkability on three community-based tourism sustainability indicators, namely, the economic, social and environmental benefits and costs impacting community’s quality of life through the lens of the triple bottom line approach with the institutional theory. Design/methodology/approach – This study views institutions as either enabling or restricting the sustainable community-based tourism because institutions influence resource integration and value assessment by the beneficiary. Moreover, institutions also lead the co-creation of sustainable community-based tourism among various stakeholders. Drawing on this conceptualisation, the notion of sustainable community-based tourism is filtered through the lens of institutional theory. Thus, this work approaches sustainable community-based tourism as a dynamic process of co-creating a tourist destination formed by different actors’ and institutions within the ecosystem of the tourist destination. Meanwhile, the triple bottom line benefits and costs experienced by the overall community would produce net effects on the residents’ perceptions of sustainable tourism. Findings – This paper classifies both tangible and intangible costs and benefits because of tourist walkability and its triple bottom line trade-offs experienced by tourists and residents. This paper penetrates new grounds by reviewing the triple bottom line impacts of tourist walkability on residents’ quality of life. Government policies as mediating variable and national culture and individual personalities of tourists and residents as moderating variables were discussed. A conceptual framework named Tourist Walkability Sustainable Tourism Impact on Residents (TWSTIR) is proposed. Finally, a Sustainable Community-based Tourism Strategic (SCBTS) model which is based on the two dimensions of intensity of tourist walkability and residents’ quality of life is proposed. Research limitations/implications – Research limitations may include a lack of assessment on political, technological and legal issues, and therefore, future research is warranted in these three areas. Some emotions and attitudes of the residents may not be captured since the Gross National Index (Gross National Happiness) may have its inherent blind spots. Practical implications – This paper would be of interest to the scholarly world, as its original idea and concluding research agenda are burrowing into a new sub-field of tourism research. In view of growth and degrowth of sustaining community-based tourism, the SCBTS model is presented to provide directions for tourism policymakers and entrepreneurs to formulate and implement appropriate strategy for the tourist walkability activity per se and investment in the accompanying infrastructure. Social implications – This paper also presents the sacrifices and inequities in the communities and the relevance of government policies, national culture and individual personalities of tourists and residents, in which the attention of tourism policymakers and the communities that thrive on the travel and tourism industry should not be neglected. Originality/value – The idea and discussion of this paper is original. This paper burrows into a new sub-field of tourism research.

Based on the journal perspective, using bibliometric method and content analysis method, through the high frequency keywords, the paper constructed a space production research knowledge system, which consisted of the evolution of space production theory, main research backgrounds, main research perspectives, main space types, main space scales, main research objectives, main research epistemology, and research representative figures, to discuss the research hotspots of space production in China. Overall, China has experienced the following stages of space production: introduction of pure space production theory/interpretation of introducing-space production theory/demonstration of analysis - space production theory/ Chinese reflection of application-space production theory/Chinese theory. It should be noted that the above stages had more or less difference in the literature accumulation, the related research literature was more in the early stages, while the literature on Chinese reflection of the space production theory, especially the relevant research literature about Chinese theory was very little and weak. However, it does not mean that the future domestic research of space production would pay less attention to early stages and more attention to later stages, it would be more reasonable to yield brilliant results in each stage for a long time in the future.

Greening and beautification measures in humid and semi-humid areas are dominated by forest landscaping and construction, protection of ancient and famous trees, rural parks and leisure green space construction, roadside and water greening. In contrast, in the arid and semi-arid areas and plateau climate areas, these measures dominantly target economic forest and fruit trees, tourism gardens, and rural tourism. On this basis, this paper summarizes the characteristics of rural greening and beautification modes in typical villages in the major climate zones of China under the guidance of four functions：settlement living environment, blue-green space, characteristic agriculture and forestry industry, and rural tourism.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Academic – Empirical,Journal article,China,Modelling|Indicator framework,Village/community,No,Unclear/Not stated,Not relevant,Yes,"Proposes a typology of 10 'typical models' of rural greening and beautification in China, derived from a cluster analysis of 374 villages.

It finds that current greening focuses more on the immediate village settlement (courtyards, roadsides) than the wider rural territory. The modes vary significantly by climate zone: humid regions prioritize scenic forests, parks, and conservation of ancient trees, while arid and plateau regions focus on economic outputs like commercial orchards, tourism gardens, and rural tourism.

A Review,Sustainability,"Rural community tourism initiatives in developed nations share most positive and negative characteristics with community-based tourism (CBT) initiatives in developing nations. They also share many barriers and conditions for tourism development. What makes them different is the context in which they operate. This paper identifies the main conditions that explain these differences through a review of findings from 103 location-specific case studies and other available literature that provides empirical evidence. The paper also explores the usage of the concepts of CBT and rural tourism. The findings are discussed under seven categories: Definitions, socioeconomic and cultural factors, policy and governance, land ownership, community cohesiveness, assimilation of external stakeholders, and type of visitors. It is argued that it is the developing-/developed-nation context, and not objectively established criteria, which largely dictates authors’ narratives with corresponding takes on tourism development and subsequent recommendations.
